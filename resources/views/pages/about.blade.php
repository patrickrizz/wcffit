				<h3>WEST COUNTY FITNESS HISTORY</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>West County Fitness started as a small dream and has turned into a reality for Emily and Jason Knisley. We were fortunate enough to be offered the opportunity to purchase West County Fitness in March of 2017. Emily and I have always been driven by fitness and living a healthy lifestyle, and to have this opportunity was both an honor and a no brainer to us. We feel very blessed to be living out our dream, which has always been to own a gym and be able to continue growing and giving back to the wonderful community that we live in.
				</p>
				<p>West County Fitness is considered a family gym. Emily and I have been in a lot of different gyms in our lifetime, and we have never been in one that is as unique as West County Fitness. When we entered West County Fitness for the first time we knew that this was a different type of atmosphere than we had ever been in before.  Everyone here is so supportive of one another. Everyone here is willing to help each other achieve their fitness goals and to teach people proper techniques and different exercises. Everyone looks out for one another and there is no judgmental attitudes at West County Fitness.  Everyone is accepted here at West County Fitness and we are all here striving to make ourselves and each other look and feel better.

				<p>Emily and I both, played several different sports when we growing up. Our desired to live healthy life styles and be the best that we could be, started at a very young age and has transpired through the years. We developed a deep passion for the health and fitness industry as well as helping people out and conveying our knowledge and experiences to others. We both are certified in several different disciplines concerning personal fitness. We are always here to help and we encourage each and every one to ask questions and seek new training techniques as well as nutritional advice. No matter what experience level you are, it never hurts to learn new things or try different techniques to help you achieve your goals.
